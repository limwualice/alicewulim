Visualization of Parking Data

As a volunteer with Hack for LA, I contributed to a project focused on visualizing parking data to understand the effects of parking policies on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis in the City of Los Angeles. My role involved connecting a data pipeline to the API, integrating Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Looker for data visualization, and implementing data cleaning and processing techniques. This project allowed me to apply my data science skills to make meaningful contributions to urban planning and policy analysis.

Specifically, I extend these results to spaces characterized by nonnegative N-Bakry Émery Ricci curvature. The study focuses on investigating the Splitting Theorem and the geodesic loops to infinity property within the context of spaces exhibiting nonnegative N-Bakry Émery Ricci curvature. Furthermore, I demonstrate that if Mn represents a complete, noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative N-Bakry Émery Ricci curvature, where N>n, the homology group Hn−1(M,ℤ) is determined to be 0.

			</a>
            <p>I'm so excited to share my thesis with you, and I hope you'll find it as fun to read as I found it enjoyable to write! All illustrations in the thesis were created using Procreate and Gravit. <br><br>

				Abstract: The thesis begins with an intuitive introduction to calculus on manifolds for non-mathematicians, followed by a semi-intuitive explanation of Ricci curvature for non-geometers. We provide descriptions of N-Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature and N-quasi Einstein metric.
				
				<br>
				
				The main focus of this thesis revolves around the N-Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature and N-quasi Einstein metric.
				
				<br>
				
				Our first set of key results encompasses the generalization of topological findings previously established for noncompact manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature to spaces exhibiting nonnegative N-Bakry Émery Ricci curvature. We delve into the exploration of the Splitting Theorem and a property known as the geodesic loops to infinity property in relation to spaces characterized by nonnegative N-Bakry Émery Ricci curvature. Additionally, we prove that if M^n is a complete, noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative N-Bakry Émery Ricci curvature, where N > n, then the homology group Hn-1(M, Z) is 0.
				
				<br>
				
				In our second set of major findings, we classify compact locally homogeneous non-gradient N-quasi Einstein 3-manifolds. Along the way, we establish that for a compact quotient of a Lie group of any dimension that is N-quasi Einstein, the potential vector field X must be both left invariant and Killing. Furthermore, we provide a classification of nontrivial N-quasi Einstein metrics that are compact quotients of the product of two Einstein metrics. Lastly, we demonstrate that S^1 is the sole compact manifold of any dimension that admits a metric which is nontrivially N-quasi Einstein and Einstein.</p>
